# 🛠️ KioskBuilder

🚀 **Configuration-driven kiosk ISO generation made simple**

> [!CAUTION]
> 🚧 This project is in early development and not working yet.

## 🧩 Overview

Creating and maintaining custom Linux ISOs for kiosk systems can be complex and time-consuming.  
KioskBuilder simplifies this process by allowing you to define your kiosk configuration in a single YAML file. This file
serves as a blueprint for generating the ISO, making it easy to customize and maintain.

## 🎯 Motivation

I want to explore how Linux ISOs are created and learn Python along the way. Creating this project helps me for my own  
systems and hopefully yours too!

## ✨ Features

✨ **Blueprint System**: Define your kiosk configuration in a single YAML file.  
⚙️ **GitHub Action**: Automate ISO generation directly from your repository.  
🖥️ **GUI Application**: A user-friendly interface for less technical users.
